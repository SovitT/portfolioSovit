    <b>Currency Converter</b>
        <pre>Project Overview

        The currency converter project is a web-based application that allows users to convert one currency to another. 
        The project consists of a user-friendly interface built using HTML and CSS, and a backend built using Java, 
        which performs the currency conversion using exchange rates.
        
        <b>User Interface</b>
        
        The user interface is designed using HTML and CSS, and it consists of a simple and intuitive form that allows
         users to input the amount and currency they want to convert. The form includes the following fields:

        Amount: a text field where the user can input the amount they want to convert
        From: a dropdown list of currencies that the user can select from
        To: a dropdown list of currencies that the user can select from
        Convert: a button that triggers the conversion process
        Backend
        
        The backend is built using Java, and it performs the currency conversion using exchange rates. The Java code
        uses   the AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that interacts 
        with the user. The GUI includes two text fields to display the input and output amounts, and two buttons to 
        trigger the conversion process.
        
        How it Works
        Here's how the project works:
        The user inputs the amount and selects the currencies they want to convert from and to using the HTML form.
        When the user clicks the "Convert" button, the HTML form sends a request to the Java backend.
        The Java backend receives the request and performs the currency conversion using the exchange rates.
        The Java backend returns the converted amount to the HTML frontend.
        The HTML frontend displays the converted amount to the user.
        Code Structure
        
        The project consists of three main files:
        
        index.html: the HTML file that contains the user interface
        style.css: the CSS file that styles the user interface
        GFG.java: the Java file that contains the backend logic
        Conclusion
        
        The currency converter project is a simple yet useful application that demonstrates the power of programming
        languages like Java, HTML, and CSS. By combining these languages, we can create a web-based application that
        is both user-friendly and functional.
